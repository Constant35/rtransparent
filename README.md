Functions that work on txt files extracted from PDFs do not end in `_pmc`. Functions that work on XML files from NLM end in `_pmc`. To run all functions on PMC use the `rt_all_pmc` function. To get all meta-data from PMC articles, use the `rt_meta_pmc` function.


## Coming soon

1. Harmonization of code - all code will adopt the naming convention used in `rt_coi_pmc.R`.
2. Commenting - more comments will be added to explain non-trivial aspects of the code.
3. Vignette - a vignette explaining how to use the code is coming.
